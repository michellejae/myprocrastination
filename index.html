          This isn’t where you thought you were going huh? Swore you clicked on
          a link for a project? Or at least a GitHub repo?
          <span id="sorry">I apologize!</span>
          I had to bring you here for a quick pit stop because if we had went to
          the real link you would have received this
          <button id="ngnix">cute little thing</button>. Or this
          <button id="security">good friend of mine</button>. Heck i may
          eventually just <button id="me">put up this good stuff</button>.

          Instead, we detoured to a special place of mine. It’s called
          <span id="procrastination">my procrastination station.</span> Here we
          find a base layer of imposter syndrome, mixed with a large chunk of
          anxiety and sprinkled with a little bit of you guessed it,
          procrastination!

          Anyways, as it is with most people, I hope to slowly update my
          projects and create new content so this site can be canned. But let’s
          be honest, I will always keep her in my back pocket. Until then, you
          can find me on my <a href="mailto:mchellejae@gmail.com">email</a>. Or crying on my couch waiting to meet new
          friends and smile at a stranger.
