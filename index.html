    <h1>Ope, Hey There!</h1>
    <p>This isn’t wear you thought you were going huh? Swore you clicked on a link for a project? Or at least a GitHub repo? I apologize, I had to bring you here for a quick pit stop you see, as if we had went to the real link you would have received this cute little thing (NGINX down). Or this good friend of mine (security vulnerabilities). Heck i may just put up this eventually ... (picture of me pulling my on my hair ).</p>

       <p> Alas, where I brought you to my special place. It’s called, my procrostatination station. Here we find a base layer of imposter syndrome, mixed with a large chunk of anxiety and sprinkled with a little bit of you guessed it! procrastination. OH and let us not forget covid. (lolz like one can forget that ... AMIRITE). </p>
        
      <p> Anyways, as it is with most people, I hope to slowly update my projects (can I get a ‘mmm hmmm’ for my fellow devs with some potential security vulnerabilities?’, make new projects and create new content so this site can be canned. But let’s be honest, I will always keep her in my back pocket. Until then, you can find me on my email. Or crying on my couch waiting to meet new friends and smile at a stranger. </p>
