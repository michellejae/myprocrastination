          This isn’t wear you thought you were going huh? Swore you clicked on a
          link for a project? Or at least a GitHub repo? <br /><strong
            ><i>I apologize!</i></strong
          ><br />
          I had to bring you here for a quick pit stop because if we had went to
          the real link you would have received this
          <button class="ngnix">cute little thing</button>. Or this
          <button class="security">good friend of mine</button>. Heck i may
          just put up <button class="me">this eventually ...</button>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, we detoured to a special place of mine. It’s called
          <span id="procrostatination">my procrostatination station</span>. Here
          we find a base layer of imposter syndrome, mixed with a large chunk of
          anxiety and sprinkled with a little bit of you guessed it,
          procrostatination!
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyways, as it is with most people, I hope to slowly update my
          projects and create new content so this site can be canned. But let’s
          be honest, I will always keep her in my back pocket. Until then, you
          can find me on my email. Or crying on my couch waiting to meet new
          friends and smile at a stranger.
