          This isn’t wear you thought you were going huh? Swore you clicked on a
          link for a project? Or at least a GitHub repo? <strong><i>I apologize,</i></strong> I had to
          bring you here for a quick pit stop because if we had went to the
          real link you would have received this cute little thing (NGINX down).
          Or this good friend of mine (security vulnerabilities). Heck i may
          just put up this eventually ... (picture of me pulling my on my hair
          ).

          Alas, where I brought you to my special place. It’s called, my
          procrostatination station. Here we find a base layer of imposter
          syndrome, mixed with a large chunk of anxiety and sprinkled with a
          little bit of you guessed it! procrastination. OH and let us not
          forget covid. (lolz like one can forget that ... AMIRITE).
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyways, as it is with most people, I hope to slowly update my
          projects (can I get a ‘mmm hmmm’ for my fellow devs with some
          potential security vulnerabilities?’, make new projects and create new
          content so this site can be canned. But let’s be honest, I will always
          keep her in my back pocket. Until then, you can find me on my email.
          Or crying on my couch waiting to meet new friends and smile at a
          stranger.
